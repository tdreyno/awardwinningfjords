    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First, go buy &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/topfunky"&gt;@topfunky&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href="https://peepcode.com/products/coffeescript"&gt;CoffeeScript PeepCode screencast&lt;/a&gt;. It's wonderful. All done? Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting pieces of information to me, as someone who's been writing a lot of CoffeeScript and has written a ton of Javascript in the past, is the subtle tweaks to style in CoffeeScript. Here are some quick preferred styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple piece of jQuery and a test case in plain Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var elem = $("#myselector").addClass("testing");
expect(elem.id).toEqual("myselector");
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Naive Conversion to CoffeeScript:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply removing semi-colons and the &lt;tt&gt;var&lt;/tt&gt; keyword isn't really enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;elem = $("#myselector").addClass("testing")
expect(elem.id).toEqual("myselector")
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lisp-y Function Grouping/Calling &amp;amp; Omitting Final parentheses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, remember that CoffeeScript doesn't require parentheses when calling functions. These two lines are rendered identically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;myfunc("string")
myfunc "string"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second version, without parentheses, is the preferred style. The general rule is: &lt;strong&gt;the final method call in a chain should omit the parentheses&lt;/strong&gt;. The original, naive conversion can become:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;elem = $("#myselector").addClass "testing"
expect(elem.id).toEqual "myselector"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, CoffeeScript prefers to use parentheses to group methods, rather than group method parameters. This subtle difference is best illustrated by the final code. I think seeing the jQuery &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt; without a parenthesis was off-putting at first, but I'm slowly learning to like it. The resulting code feels more math-y (or Lisp-y).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Preferred Style&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;elem = ($ "#myselector").addClass "testing"
(expect elem.id).toEqual "myselector"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week at &lt;a href="http://2011.jsconf.us/"&gt;jsconf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://mir.aculo.us/"&gt;Thomas Fuchs&lt;/a&gt; continued his argument for small frameworks with the release of &lt;a href="http://microjs.com/"&gt;MicroJS&lt;/a&gt; which acts as a listing of tiny, single-purpose libraries. The idea being that freedom and choice, combined with optimizing for size will result in a better product than using a larger, monolithic "framework."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what are we talking about when we say "framework" and what kind of applications can be built with microframeworks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Two Types of HTML Applications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is useful to denominate the two kinds of web applications that exist on the web. First, there is the traditional "Progressive Enhancement" apps. These use Javascript to bring additional interaction, animation and life to static HTML/CSS. The benefit is that even if the client has problems with Javascript due to some esoteric IE bug, or their phone doesn't support Javascript, that they can still interact with the site normally. The majority of large sites using jQuery act in this way. They output HTML from the backend and then jQuery adds interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second type is the MVC application. These frameworks start from a blank slate and use their own Views (templates) to build up the components of an app. This view layer certainly adds complexity (and lines of code) to the framework, but the result is usually a more Desktop-like user experience. The big frameworks of this type are &lt;a href="http://blog.sproutcore.com/"&gt;Sproutcore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://cappuccino.org/"&gt;Cappuccino&lt;/a&gt; and to a lesser degree, &lt;a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/"&gt;Backbone.js&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://skilldrick.co.uk/2011/05/javascript-and-the-end-of-progressive-enhancement/comment-page-1/"&gt;Nick Morgan argues that these types of app are the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll need to keep in mind both types of applications as we think about optimization. What benefits one might not benefit the other and it's important to figure out the kind of app a person is talking about when they are discussing "microframeworks."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the web, speed is king. Yahoo and Amazon have shown that every additional millisecond it takes to load your page has a direct result in decreasing sales. Right now, the biggest bottleneck is the way javascript loading blocks rendering in the browser. The modern web craves javascript. The browser is just an empty shell until it is scripted to life. This means the entire stack of web interactivity has to be written in Javascript and it has to be transferred to every single client who views the site. There are 3 solutions to this problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Great Cache in the Sky&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jQuery is now present on about 44% of websites. jQuery also weighs about 130k (before minification and gzipping). Which means after just a little casual browsing, you've probably downloaded jQuery several times. Browsers cache Javascript based on which domain it was downloaded from, which means your browser is actually storing 1 copy of jQuery for every site you visited that used it. And, even though you have a dozen copies already, it's going to download it again when you change to a new site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jQuery project and Google both offer to serve jQuery from their respective CDNs. These CDNs are heavily optimized to get clients a copy of jQuery as quickly as possible and they have the added bonus of using a consistent URL. That means if domaina.com and domainb.com both point to Google's copy of jQuery, then they will share the same file in the cache. This means domainb.com and all subsequent domains you visit using the Google CDN copy of jQuery won't have to be delayed waiting for jQuery to download, it will already be in the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great idea. With jQuery on 44% of the web, it's time to admit that it is the "standard library" of the web. Personally, I think Google Chrome should ship with the last dozen versions of jQuery embedded and have an option to prefer the local copies over downloading a new one. The standard library should ship with the language (in the browser). I think this will happen some day, but until then...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Load Asynchronously&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a handful of popular new tools for loading your Javascript without blocking such as LABjs, RequireJS, StealJS, yepnope and script.js. Of course, these tools are themselves written in Javascript and must be first loaded in a blocking fashion. However, they are usually small enough that this isn't a real issue. Once the script loader is ready, it will begin pulling in your other Javascript files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous script loading works great for apps using "progressive enhancement", you can off-load almost all the Javascript, including jQuery, until later and when it finally loads the page simply gets a little nicer and interactive. However, to the user it looks like the page is loaded and they can begin interacting immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"MVC Applications" require more complicated organization and packaging to work asynchronously. They need to know which parts of the app can be loaded later and which are needed immediately. The larger frameworks, like &lt;a href="http://blog.sproutcore.com/"&gt;Sproutcore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://javascriptmvc.com/"&gt;JavascriptMVC&lt;/a&gt;, have already solved this problem, but it does add some conceptual overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Use Less Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put: send less data to the client. Sounds easy? Remember that jQuery is 130k before you even start writing your own code. This is where Thomas Fuchs (and &lt;a href="http://microjs.com/"&gt;MicroJS&lt;/a&gt;) come in. He argues that "frameworks" are too big and include stuff that you probably don't need. He, and others, seem purposefully vague about which framework they are rebelling against, but let's be honest: it's jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've built some large applications of both the Progressive Enhancement and MVC varieties and initially I couldn't understand how a seasoned developer could possibly argue that glueing a dozen plugins together is better than a consistent application framework. Tom Dale, of the Sproutcore team, &lt;a href="http://tomdale.net/2011/04/imagine-a-beowulf-cluster-of-javascript-frameworks/"&gt;was similarly flabbergasted&lt;/a&gt;. While I agree with everything Tom writes in that article, I think he got hung up on terminology. Thomas Fuchs isn't arguing against Sproutcore, he is covertly arguing against jQuery. I, Thomas Reynolds (let's call this the Mexican Standoff of Javacript Toms), personally love Sproutcore and so I'll spend the rest of this article talking about replacing jQuery for Progressively Enhanced apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Replacing jQuery Piece by Piece&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is jQuery? Do most developers use everything available? Here are the core functions and their current file sizes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selector Engine (33k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOM Manipulation (21k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOM Attributes (16k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOM Data Storage (9k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core Helpers and Plugin Framework: $.each, $.extend, etc (23k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS reading/writing/animating (26k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AJAX (26k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events (32k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deferreds (5k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Take a look at that list and then take a look at &lt;a href="http://microjs.com/"&gt;MicroJS&lt;/a&gt;. Look familiar? The majority of these micro libraries take aim at a specific portion of jQuery and attempt to do it in a smaller file size. Sound great? If you're optimizing for size it does, but let me issue a word of warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;jQuery is used on 44% of the web. It is better tested, has more users and has better browser support than any other framework. It is a very well organized project which is continuing to improve and increase performance on every release. I agree with Yehuda Katz, the most important piece of any framework is the size, age and knowledge of its community. Therefore, I believe these new micro libraries will be forced to re-learn the same lessons (whether it be browser support or speed optimization) that jQuery has already solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Enter Ender.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ender.no.de/"&gt;Ender.js&lt;/a&gt; is a framework framework. It attempts to provide a scaffold roughly shaped like jQuery with places to plugin micro libraries of your choice to fill in the features. Then Ender.js will glue those parts together and produce either a single output file or a file which loads each component asynchronously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default jQuery-like bundle is called "jeesh" and includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selector Engine (Qwery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOM Manipulation (Bonzo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOM Attributes (Bonzo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DOM Data Storage (Bonzo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core Helpers and Plugin Framework: $.each, $.extend, etc (Underscore &amp;amp; Klass)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS reading/writing/animating (Émile)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AJAX (Reqwest)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events (Bean)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These pieces fit together nicely and create an almost drop-in replacement for jQuery. The edges are a little rough and you will have to rewrite some code to use it. &lt;a href="http://www.dustindiaz.com/"&gt;Dustin Diaz&lt;/a&gt; wrote almost all of theses default libraries, so atleast there is some consistency. As Ender.js gets more popular and more libraries are integrated which weren't written by Dustin, I expect the API will get more and more awkward. As I said above, while Dustin is a very smart person (and he's had help from Thomas Fuchs as well), neither can match jQuery's maturity, test suite and institutional knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, if you're optimizing for size on a Progressively Enhanced app, Ender.js is a nice fit. If you're optimizing for consistency and the ability to hire and bring new developers up-to-speed quickly, then you should probably stick with jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Anecdotal "Evidence"&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a small Progressively Enhanced portfolio site. I've completed the homepage, which uses 2 "plugins" for some slideshows and some helper functions. The initial build was with jQuery and the jQueryUI widget factory. Minified: &lt;u&gt;109k&lt;/u&gt;, the majority of that being jQuery which I wasn't really using that many features of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I ported the site to JavascriptMVC which has a very nice dependency management system and only pulls in the pieces you need (and jQuery). The coding-style was nicer, the code modularized and the minified output was: &lt;u&gt;110k&lt;/u&gt;. Makes sense, it has all of jQuery plus a 1k of glue code (Class system + Controllers). I'd really like to see JavascriptMVC (and Sproutcore too), break up jQuery into it's components and rely on those directly. Their dependency management systems can handle this and it should reduce the file system for relatively simple apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I used Ender with Bonzo, Émile, Bean, Qwery and &lt;a href="http://extralogical.net/projects/firmin/"&gt;Firmin&lt;/a&gt;. I had to change some stuff around and basically invent a micro controller system, but the minified output was only: &lt;u&gt;38k&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, not a surprise, when competing purely on size, microframeworks and Ender.js win. I didn't really love the code I had to write for the Ender.js version and I don't appreciate opening 4 different documentation pages to figure out the methods. Still, I'll probably stick with it because the project has only a single developer, doesn't require great IE compatibility and my primary goal is speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are going to keep talking about microframeworks, but I don't see jQuery's usage decreasing at all. Developer Happiness should be the primary goal, but we can't work on that until these technical issues of memory, cpu usage, gpu usage and blocking scripts are solved. They will be solved and looking back, these will feel like the dark ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what I'm looking forward to in the "future." I'd like to see an end-to-end framework written in CoffeeScript. Models, Views and Controllers are the same code and the decision whether to execute code on the client or the server can be optimized. Doing the same database requests? Optimize and cache it on the backend. Rendering the same views? Do it on the backend. I'd like to see the client open a connection to the node.js backend and pipeline scripts and data as needed. If something would be faster on the client side, build it into a module and pipe it to the client on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don't think we'll be waiting too much longer for such a system. A first step can be seen in Shopify's &lt;a href="http://batmanjs.org/"&gt;batman.js&lt;/a&gt; which made a huge splash at jsconf. Property binding is huge (also at the heart of Sproutcore) and reduces the need for jQuery's DOM manipulation hammer. Can't wait to play with it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$.cssHooks['pirateBackground'] = {
  get: function(elem, computed, extra) {
    return "yaarrr";
  },
  set: function(elem, value) {

  }
};

$(elem).css({ pirateBackground: 'red' });
// elem now has a red background and the pirates.png pattern

$(elem).css('pirateBackground') == "yaarrr"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included in David DeSandro's excellent &lt;a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/"&gt;Isotope&lt;/a&gt; library are &lt;a href="https://github.com/desandro/isotope/blob/a2a238968347199842dd7e2d552741d5a63c90b9/jquery.isotope.js"&gt;csshooks for CSS3 scale and translate&lt;/a&gt;. These hooks correctly use the fast 3d-transforms if available. I've included the full implementation below, but the important part is that you can include the following gist and use it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Double the size using CSS3 transform scale 
$(elem).css({ scale: [2] })

// Move the element 100px right and 200px down
$(elem).css({ translate: [ 100, 200 ] })
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$('.2x').click(function() {
  $('.square').css({ scale: [2] })
});

$('.1x').click(function() {
  $('.square').css({ scale: [1] })
});

$('.right').click(function() {
  $('.square').css({ translate: [150, 0] })
});

$('.left').click(function() {
  $('.square').css({ translate: [25, 0] })
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    loadImageCache[imageSrc] = deferred;
  }

  return loadImageCache[imageSrc];
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requires jQuery 1.5 or newer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;loadImage("http://my/image.jpg").then(function(url) {
  alert(url + ' is preloaded');
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code will only preload each url once, you can reuse the deferred object and add additional &lt;tt&gt;then&lt;/tt&gt; callbacks to that object anywhere in your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;RubyGems-test support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Bundler for packaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at some of these in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="features"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Feature/Extension API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the "features" of Middleman can be enabled or disabled from your &lt;tt&gt;config.rb&lt;/tt&gt; file. These features are now all using the Sinatra extension API which means it is very easy to add your own features or include features from other RubyGems. Here is an example Feature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# In your config.rb or an external file/gem required in config.rb
module MyMiddlemanFeature
  class &amp;lt;&amp;lt; self
    def registered(app)
      app.helpers MyMiddlemanFeature::Helpers
    end
    alias :included :registered
  end

  module Helpers
    def my_custom_helper
      "Hello World"
    end
  end
end

# In config.rb
activate MyMiddlemanFeature
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above extension will add some helpers to your project. Of course, there is already the shortcut &lt;tt&gt;helpers&lt;/tt&gt; block available in &lt;tt&gt;config.rb&lt;/tt&gt;, but this extension could live anywhere. If you have some reusable components or business logic, you can place those in a gem, share it within your company and include it in &lt;tt&gt;config.rb&lt;/tt&gt;. I use this for a custom grid-system I reuse on a lot of projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, existing Sinatra extensions should work too. &lt;a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/extensions-wild.html"&gt;See more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="yaml"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;YAML Data API&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavier static systems like Nanoc have a robust system for separating data from your HTML. This is great for sharing content across pages or having simpler files which content-focused co-workers can update without touching HTML. It's not documented, but because Middleman runs on Sinatra, it's possible to open database connections and pull data in that way already, but that's a bit must. Middleman 1.1 comes with a simple data API. Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a folder in the root of your project named &lt;tt&gt;data&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create as many &lt;tt&gt;.yml&lt;/tt&gt; YAML files as you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their contents will be made available in your templates as &lt;tt&gt;data["filename"]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// In PROJECT_ROOT/data/people.yml
friends:
  - tom
  - dick
  - harry

// In my template
%h1 Friends
%ul
  - data.people.friends.each do |f|
    %li= f
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="lorem"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lorem Ipsum &amp;amp; Placehold.it helpers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/blahed/frank"&gt;Frank project&lt;/a&gt;, a static tool also inspired by Sinatra, has a wonderful set of helpers for generating random text content and placeholder images. I'm adapted this code for Middleman (god bless the MIT license). The API is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;lorem.sentence      # returns a single sentence
lorem.words 5       # returns 5 individual words
lorem.word
lorem.paragraphs 10 # returns 10 paragraphs 
lorem.paragraph
lorem.date          # accepts a strftime format argument
lorem.name
lorem.first_name
lorem.last_name
lorem.email
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to use placeholder images:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;lorem.image('300x400')
#=&amp;gt; http://placehold.it/300x400

lorem.image('300x400', :background_color =&amp;gt; '333', :color =&amp;gt; 'fff')
#=&amp;gt; http://placehold.it/300x400/333/fff

lorem.image('300x400', :random_color =&amp;gt; true)
#=&amp;gt; http://placehold.it/300x400/f47av7/9fbc34d

lorem.image('300x400', :text =&amp;gt; 'blah')
#=&amp;gt; http://placehold.it/300x400&amp;amp;text=blah
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="boilerplate"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Project Templates (HTML5 Boilerplate)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've abstracted the templates used in &lt;tt&gt;mm-init&lt;/tt&gt; so that it is easy to add new ones, but right now those templates have to live in the Middleman gem to work. In the future, I'll add support for extra templates in external gems or somewhere on the local machine like &lt;tt&gt;~/.middleman&lt;/tt&gt;. For now, enjoy the new template option, the wonderful &lt;a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/"&gt;HTML5 Boilerplate&lt;/a&gt;. It is used like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mm-init my_boilerplate_project --template=html5
    create  my_boilerplate_project/config.rb
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/404.html
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/apple-touch-icon.png
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/crossdomain.xml
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/css/handheld.css
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/css/style.css
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/favicon.ico
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/humans.txt
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/images/.gitignore
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/index.html
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/js/libs/dd_belatedpng.js
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/js/libs/jquery-1.5.0.js
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/js/libs/jquery-1.5.0.min.js
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/js/libs/modernizr-1.6.min.js
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/js/mylibs/.gitignore
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/js/plugins.js
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/js/script.js
    create  my_boilerplate_project/public/robots.txt
    create  my_boilerplate_project/views
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rack-support by Default&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a very simple Rack &lt;tt&gt;config.ru&lt;/tt&gt; file is included in the default template. It's contents are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;require 'rubygems'
require 'middleman'

run Middleman::Server
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows Middleman to easily run on a Heroku instance or under 37Signal's new &lt;a href="http://pow.cx/"&gt;Pow webserver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As easy as ever:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem install middleman
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Quick question? What is the perfect amount of time to animate an element on a page? jQuery defaults to 400ms, which sounds short, but ends up being pretty perfect for most occasions. It gets the job done and then it gets out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it shouldn't surprise you that designers have opinions on motion and we're just now reaching the point where motion is becoming important on the web.  Back in the day, 37Signals would just set the background of an element to yellow and call it a day. If you take a look at &lt;a href="http://getflow.com"&gt;Flow&lt;/a&gt;, you'll see some very designed motion. Closing a task results in the checkbox animating to a state, then it picks up and animates along an arc to drop into the "completed" box in your sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so, what's the perfect timing for that animation? There are tools for prototyping motion, most notably Adobe Flash, but usually you're designer is going to want to look over your shoulder and tweak the animation until it "feels right."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is something I've seen friends in the old-school OpenGL motion build into their dev workflow. Every time they've got a motion variable (duration, size, color, wobble, randomness, etc), they setup a control to adjust the variable. Who wants to change integers in OpenGL and recompile? Like so many things, it's time to re-learn tricks from the desktop world if we're going to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, below is the most basic example. I have a square that is animating back and forth and changing width and height. In a more complicated example, it might arc or have several animations queued up. I've used a shiny new HTML5 &lt;tt&gt;range&lt;/tt&gt; element and each time the animation loops, it checks the value to define it's duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- Ranges from 0-4000, with integer steps. Defaults to 400 --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;input type="range" min="0" max="4000" step="1" value="400"&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The animation looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$elem.animate({ left: 480, width: 100, height: 100 }, {
  duration: $("input[type=range]").val()
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple enough. If I were implementing an animation, vaguely defined in a PSD, I'd setup something like this and then let the designer have a field day. Developers love round numbers and math, but the "best" timing may actually be the combination of an esoteric easing function and a duration of 962.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gets even more interesting if you're using something like WebGL, Three.js or Box2d.js. Adjust physics engines on the fly makes finding the perfect balance a cinch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Demo&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have a little animating square, a slider to control the duration and a bunch of easing options. Go ahead, play around and find the "sweet spot."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"&gt;
  $.getScript("/javascripts/jquery.easing.1.3.js", function() {

    $(function($) {
      $(".range").change(function() {
        $(".speed").text($(this).val());
      }).change();

      function getEasing() {
        return $(".easing").val();
      }

      function getSliderValue() {
        return parseInt($(".range").val(), 10);
      }

      function animateRight() {
        $(".box").stop().animate({ left: 380, width: 100, height: 100 }, {
          duration: getSliderValue(), 
          easing:   getEasing(),
          complete: function() {
            setTimeout(animateLeft, 750);
          }
        });
      }

      function animateLeft() {
        $(".box").stop().animate({ left: 0, width: 50, height: 50 }, {
          duration: getSliderValue(), 
          easing:   getEasing(),
          complete: function() {
            setTimeout(animateRight, 750);
          }
        });
      }

      animateRight();
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;div class="demo" style="width: 600px; height: 300px; position: relative; overflow: hidden;"&gt;
  Duration: &lt;span class="speed"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;input class="range" type="range" min="0" max="4000" step="1" value="1400" style="width: 300;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Easing: &lt;select class="easing"&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;swing&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeInQuad&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeOutQuad&lt;/option&gt;

    &lt;option&gt;easeInCubic&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeOutCubic&lt;/option&gt;

    &lt;option&gt;easeOutQuart&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeInOutQuart&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeInQuint&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeOutQuint&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeInOutQuint&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeInSine&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeOutSine&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeInOutSine&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeInExpo&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeOutExpo&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeInOutExpo&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeInCirc&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeOutCirc&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;option&gt;easeInOutCirc&lt;/option&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year at SXSW I was either involved in or overheard the same conversation several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Person A: So where do you work now?
Person B: Just started a new job at Company X.
Person A: Ah, man, you should have told me you were looking. 
          I'd love to work with you.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, despite all of our constant communication and over-sharing on Twitter, we still like to avoid "serious" conversations about jobs, salaries and what it would take to get your friend/buddy/idol to work with you. So, to scratch this itch, &lt;a href="http://pixelmatrixdesign.com/"&gt;Josh Pyles&lt;/a&gt; and I spent the last weekend putting together &lt;a href="http://wouldhire.com"&gt;WouldHire.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year at SXSW I was either involved in or overheard the same conversation several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Person A: So where do you work now?
Person B: Just started a new job at Company X.
Person A: Ah, man, you should have told me you were looking. 
          I'd love to work with you.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is very simple. Go to the homepage, enter your twitter username and see if anyone has expressed interest in working with you. If they have and you're looking for a new gig, it's up to you two to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wouldhire.com"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/WouldHire-homepage.png" alt="Homepage"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://who.wouldhire.com/pixelmatrix"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/WouldHire-who.png" alt="Who WouldHire @pixelmatrix"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you're looking to let someone know that you're interested, simply login (using Twitter) and add some Twitter usernames to your "dream team."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/WouldHire-admin.png" alt="WouldHire Admin"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool, eh? Please check it out, email me your ideas/comments and hopefully this will help someone, somewhere end up with their dream job.&lt;/p&gt;

So, let's take a look at what PubSub means, how you can use it in jQuery and some very naive example code.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are some very common front-end development patterns that drive me crazy. CSS with every style related to a specific selector on one line and IE-only stylesheets with conditional comments are both common place and even encouraged by some. But the worst, in my opinion, is breaking our CSS into multiple files in an attempt to make them "themable." Usually this results in something like a &lt;tt&gt;main.css&lt;/tt&gt; and a &lt;tt&gt;fonts.css&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;colors.css&lt;/tt&gt;. Having a go-to file for designers to manipulate fonts and colors is very useful, but usually the structure of this secondary file mirrors the primary file and you end up with a lot of repetition. Furthermore, if your DOM structure changes, then you will need to update multiple files (&lt;tt&gt;ie.css&lt;/tt&gt; results in a similar problem).&lt;/p&gt;

The earlier features of Sass were basically macros. They grabbed a piece of CSS from either a mixin definition or an external file and inserted that CSS into the output. @extend actually manipulates the selectors and uses CSS's own cascading inheritance system simplify code and avoid duplication.

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a new site which will eventually run on PHP5. Going back to raw CSS isn't really an option because I value my time and sanity. Thankfully there may be a way to run Sass' new format, &lt;a href="http://nex-3.com/posts/96-scss-sass-is-a-css-extension"&gt;SCSS&lt;/a&gt;, under PHP using &lt;a href="http://github.com/anthonyshort/csscaffold"&gt;Anthony Short's CSScaffold project&lt;/a&gt;. The project provides a CSS preprocessor, like Sass, which runs on PHP. Currently, the project's syntax is similar, but different, than either Less or SCSS. Thankfully, Anthony has said he is working on bringing CSScaffold in-line with the SCSS syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1990, I was 7 years old. Needless to say, by 17 I still didn't have the most refined musical tastes. I'm just now getting into Pavement, Jawbox and My Bloody Valentine. So, this past decade has been my first where I can remember listening to each of the following albums when they were released. Most of the lists I've seen so far are exceptionally myopic, with albums mostly from the past 3-4 years and enjoy Radiohead to look cool. My list is hopefully more diverse. I've also used my actual listening habits (courtesy of last.fm) for ranking, rather than pretending I actually listened to The White Stripes ever single day like some lists.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically it runs inside .NET's new MVC architecture. This implementation is missing quite a few Haml niceties and the language has actually been altered in many places to be more C#-like. Personally, I think this is a poor decision. Imagine if Javascript had different syntax depending on the browser it was running in? Well... I guess Microsoft has JScript and VBScript so maybe this is just how Windows programmers operate. But, I digress. Here are some gotchas should you contemplate using NHaml.&lt;/p&gt;

If at some point, you want to tweak these styles, you'll need to track down and update each set of styles. Sass introduces the concept of mixins which are blocks of nested Sass code which can be applied to any selector in your Sass document. Think of them as variables which can hold multiple levels of information. The syntax for defining a module is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
