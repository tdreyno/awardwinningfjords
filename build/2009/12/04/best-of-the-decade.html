<p>In 1990, I was 7 years old. Needless to say, by 17 I still didn't have the most refined musical tastes. I'm just now getting into Pavement, Jawbox and My Bloody Valentine. So, this past decade has been my first where I can remember listening to each of the following albums when they were released. Most of the lists I've seen so far are exceptionally myopic, with albums mostly from the past 3-4 years and enjoy Radiohead to look cool. My list is hopefully more diverse. I've also used my actual listening habits (courtesy of last.fm) for ranking, rather than pretending I actually listened to The White Stripes ever single day like some lists.</p>


<p>Let's get started, with numbers 50-26:</p>

<h2>Panic at the Disco - A Fever You Can't Sweat Out</h2>
      <p>Listening to this recently, the autotune burned my ears, but I can't pretend I didn't have this on repeat when it came out. It's pretty cheesy, but the non-autotuned vocals are catchy and the songs varied. Their sophomore album tried to prove they had actual talent by simplifying their sound and foregoing the autotune, but it wasn't nearly as fun as this.</p>

      <h6>2006</h6>
<h2>Mogwai - Mr Beast</h2>
      <p>One of my favorite post-rock albums and an album that sat in my record player for months on end. I'm not sure I could explain it if I wanted to. It's post rock, it climaxes and the timing is just about perfect on this album.</p>

    <div class="content">
      <h6>2002</h6>
<h2>Bad Religion - The Process of Belief</h2>
      <p>The last half of the 90s were pretty hard on Bad Religion. Maybe they were just busy working on other things. The return of Brett Gurewitz on guitar helped propel their comeback. The first 3 songs work great together and are usually played in rapid succession live. I think this is their best work this decade, but The Empire Strikes First and New Maps of Hell are no slouches either.</p>

      <h6>2006</h6>
<h2>Scissor Sisters - Ta-Dah</h2>
      <p>I once described this as the "gayest album I play loud and sing along to" and if you've scanned ahead, you'll know Justin Timberlake is on this list. So that's saying something. This disco-y album with Elton John on a lot of the tracks and featuring far too graphic sexual lyrics is just too much fun. Also, the "I Can't Decide" sing-along The Master had in that Dr. Who finale was just plain awesome.</p>

<h2>Transplants - Haunted Cities</h2>
      <p>Both Transplants albums came out this decade. The self-titled is excellent, but despite their best efforts it's still a punk album. However, they hit the nail on the head in their second attempt. This is an Oakland hip hop album. Travis Barker on drums kicks the shit out of any studio drum machine.</p>

      <h6>2001</h6>
<h2>System of a Down - Toxicity</h2>
      <p>System of a Down hit their stride on Toxicity after an excellent, manic self-titled album in the late 90s. How much strong material did they write? Well, they released a 16-song collection of B-sides called "Steal This Album!" a year later and it's almost good enough to be on this list as well. Their later double-albums Memorize &amp; Hypnotize are excellent, but the band's dynamic was different. So I'm sticking with this classic SOAD.</p>

<h2>Mindless Self Indulgence - You'll Rebel To Anything</h2>
      <p>Frankenstein Girls Will Seem Strangely Sexy should be on this list. It's awesome, but it came out in 2000 and I remember listening to it on Winamp so maybe it's just too 90s. Instead, I'm going with their follow-up. A band known for vile, 90 seconds songs of pure IDM madness decided to make 10, very polished, well-produced songs.</p>

<h2>My Chemical Romance - Three Cheers for Sweet Romance</h2>
      <p>This album rips all the way through. It's speed and length matched perfectly up to my normal workout, so this was my default playlist for several years. It helps that I'm a sucker for comic books and concept albums and this album combines both.</p>

<h2>Of Montreal - Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?</h2>
      <p>I'm not sure I could even describe this album or band. Dancey, poppy, random genres, disjointed, nonsense lyrics and pure awesome. This might be the most musically creative band on this list. It makes me feel boring.</p>

<h2>Deftones - White Pony</h2>
      <p>Maybe this belongs in the 90s, but Deftones finally got it right in 2000 and I'm not going to take that away from them. This dark and violent album is all the more creepy thanks to Chino's soft voice and a guest spot from king of singing, Maynard James Keenan.</p>

<h2>The Mae Shi - Hlllyh</h2>
      <p>I love punk rock, but there were only a couple options left to the genre this decade. Either it could follow Blink 182 into the realm of pop, put out retro albums like Bad Religion, NOFX and Propagandhi or cross-pollinate with the electronic scene like Panic! at the Disco. The Mae Shi chose the latter and create a manic, sometimes melodic, album that rocks all the way through.</p>

<h2>Sum 41 - Chuck</h2>
      <p>Actually, there was one other option for punk bands, but I think Sum 41 was the only one that tried it. They decided to become a metal band. The vocals and melody remain true to the band's pop-punk style, but the guitars decided to imitate those of punk's former worst enemy. I'm a huge fan of this album, it's too bad it didn't go over well and the band has returned to their immature pop-punk style.</p>

<h2>Fall Out Boy - Infinity on High</h2>
      <p>This decade's king of pop-punk decided to give up any illusion of punk and had hip-hop producer Babyface produce this album. The intro features Jay-Z and the guitars have mostly been muddled into an electronic sound or mixed out. The thing is, they made a perfect pop album and it's fun. Their follow-up, Folie á Deux is also excellent and even more polished, if not as cohesive.</p>

<h2>Queens of the Stone Age - Songs for the Deaf</h2>
      <p>When people shit on "Rock music," I can't help but argue because this is the album I hear in my head. Needless to say, it rocks and Dave Grohl on drums pushes it up to 11.</p>

<h2>Big D and the Kids Table - Strictly Rude</h2>
      <p>I should have put every Big D album on this list. Somehow they are all equally good and yet always different. Strictly Rude builds on How it Goes's departure from loud punk, but it also brings in a UK-ska feel. 15 great songs. 2009's Fluent in Stroll is excellent too, with it's surf-ska-rock feel, but it's a little too recent to be a classic already.</p>

<h2>Ozma - Rock and Rock Part 3</h2>
      <p>Everyone knows the absolute failure Weezer has been this decade, but at the beginning we had Ozma to make up for it. This album isn't entirely cohesive, but there are so many gems, including the epic Baseball. You owe it to yourself to listen to it.</p>

<h2>The Mars Volta - De-Loused in the Comatorium</h2>
      <p>Speaking of bands I failed to get into until it was too late, At the Drive-In broke up in 2001 after finally making it "big." Thankfully the core of the band continued as The Mars Volta. Swapping crazy punk-ish rock for progressive rock. The insane vocals remained. This is another concept album, so you know I can't help but love it.</p>

<h2>Common Rider - This is Unity Music</h2>
      <p>I've already mentioned The Transplants, which featured former Operation Ive member Tim Armstrong. Thankfully, Jesse formed a new band as well. Common Rider is vaguely ska, but mostly held together by Jesse's vocals. Their debut, Last Wave Rockers, is excellent as well, but it came out in 1999.</p>

<h2>The National - Boxer</h2>
      <p>Along with shoegaze, post-punk made a little comeback this decade. The National is doing it better than anyone else right now. Sorry Interpol, you got outdone.</p>

<h2>Clint Mansell (w/ Mogwai &amp; Kronos Quartet) - The Fountain (Music from the Motion Picture)</h2>
      <p>Holy crap! As if post-rock albums weren't epic enough, they had to write one about a century-spanning romantic, sci-fi beauty. The music perfectly matches the movie and the crescendo of the album (and film), "Death Is The Road To Awe" can't be beat.</p>

<h2>Kanye West - Late Registration</h2>
      <p>Kanye's most consistent and best produced work. Featuring folks like Michel Gondry and Jon Brion ridding shotgun. 808s and Heartbreak is very interesting, but I'm going with "classic" Kanye.</p>

<h2>The Distillers - Coral Fang</h2>
      <p>The definitive break-up album. The album was written during, and focusing on, the lead singer's divorce from Transplant's Tim Armstrong and new relationship with Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme. I seriously hope I never make a woman as angry as Brody is on this album.</p>

<h2>The Dresden Dolls - Yes Virginia</h2>
      <p>The terrific twosome reigned in their self-title's burlesque punk sounds and creates this quirky masterpiece. The first half bounces around with great piano pieces and weird, chirping vocals. The second half slows down a little, but it's still great.</p>

<h2>Leftover Crack - Mediocre Generica</h2>
      <p>The band's "tower-toppling release of 9/11/01" is one of the best punk albums of the decade and one of the best ska-punk albums of all time. Styz's anti-religion, anti-intolerance and pro-anarchy lyrics are top notch.</p>
