Check out the whole thing at: [https://developers.google.com/events/io/](https://developers.google.com/events/io/) and see if you can find all the unlockable modes via 8-bit I/O patterns.

### HTML5Rocks Case Study

We wrote about some of the technical details of the project for HTML5Rocks at: [http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/casestudies/google-io-2013/](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/casestudies/google-io-2013/)

### Open Source

We also open sourced the code. It's on Github at: [https://github.com/Instrument/google-io-2013](https://github.com/Instrument/google-io-2013)

### Make Your Own Mode Tutorial

Finally, we forked the open source project to add our own "3rd party" experiment called "Flip Mode", which you can check out here: [http://instrument.github.io/google-io-2013-flip-mode/modes/flip.html](http://instrument.github.io/google-io-2013-flip-mode/modes/flip.html)

The tutorial for how others can create their own modes is on the Instrument Blog: [http://weareinstrument.com/blog/all/google-i-o-2013-open-source](http://weareinstrument.com/blog/all/google-i-o-2013-open-source)
