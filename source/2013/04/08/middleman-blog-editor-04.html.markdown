I'm happy to announce [Middleman Blog Editor v0.4](http://middleman-blog-editor.awardwinningfjords.com), the second feature release of the project. With this release comes two big features and a bump in price to $12. [You can purchase a license here](http://register.tdreyno.com). Existing users get free updates all the way until the 2.0 release. The next release, the price will be bumped to $18.

The first new feature is the ability to "Open in editor" via a button on the preview pages of the blog entries. If you're looking at `/2013-04-08-my-article`, there will be an "Edit" link in the top-right to jump you directly into the editor.

The second feature is a big one:

### Markdown Editing

Now markdown articles, `.md` and `.markdown` templates, have their own editor. The default view mirrors your content back to you and allows you to toggle between editing and previewing with a click. There is also a split-screen "focus" mode which allows you to edit articles full screen and stay focused.
