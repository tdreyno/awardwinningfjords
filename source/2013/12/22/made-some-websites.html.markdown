Looking back over 2013, I'm pretty proud of the projects I was able to work on. Of course, I've had no meaningful output on this blog since April, but other than that I was quite busy. Most of these projects were group efforts with multiple developers and the rest of my co-workers at [Instrument](http://weareinstrument.com).

## [How Search Works](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/howsearchworks/thestory/)

This 13,000px tall website tells the story of how Google searches the internet in an accurate, but whimsical, way. I was an attempt on our behalf to so a "super scroll narrative" without the 1-to-1 parallax scrolling effect so popular at the time.

## [Google I/O](https://developers.google.com/events/io/experiment)

This was my second year working on the I/O experiment. This year, we build a Wario World-inspired series of mobile games which could be unlocked by entering binary patterns into the new I/O logo.

## Coke Mobile Experiments

I built 2 mobile toys for the Coke ahh.com campaign this summer. These, especially Flip The Cap, were really fun on mobile.

## [Android.com](http://www.android.com)

We rebuilt Android's home on the web, kept things simple, brought in some nice moments of suprise &amp; delight... all the while keeping the page weight very light on mobile (250kb homepage!).

## [Google Zeitgeist](http://www.google.com/zeitgeist)

Discover the top searches and G+ photos in this beautifully animated, infinite grid. It's an absolute joy to use on tablet or with a nice trackpad.
