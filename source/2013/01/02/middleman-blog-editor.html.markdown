I'm incredibly excited to announce my holiday project: the [Middleman Blog Editor](http://middleman-blog-editor.awardwinningfjords.com). This is my first paid extension for [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) and one that I hope will prove that the community is large and mature enough for 3rd-party features and extensions to have become valuable.

Middleman Blog Editor is an extension which uses Middleman Blog to provide a beautiful organizational interface and  WYSIWYG editing. The UI can currently publish/unpublish articles, edit tags, change the article date and URL.

This extension makes it possible to host a Middleman Blog and give the editor URL to a client so they can add content. Files are modified in-place, so committing those changes to source control or deploying new builds is up to you.

## [Purchase](http://register.tdreyno.com)

Help make this experiment a success, you can purchase the extension for **$6** at: http://register.tdreyno.com

There will be 5 feature releases. Pricing will be a simple multiple of the price (**$30**), by the current version. **Free updates for the entire 1.0.x line, after initial purchase.**
